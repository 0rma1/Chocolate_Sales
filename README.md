# Sales Data Analysis with Excel, SQL & Power BI

About the Project

This personal portfolio project was created to strengthen and showcase my practical skills in data analysis using Excel, PostgreSQL (SQL), and Power BI.The dataset is fictional and used solely for educational purposes.

The main goal was to walk through the entire analysis pipeline:

Clean and prepare raw sales data using advanced Excel tools (formulas, formatting, and data validation)

Create a relational database schema and insert data into PostgreSQL using SQL scripts

Write analytical SQL queries including aggregations, joins, filters, window functions, and ranking

Visualize key insights using Power BI, including interactive filters and dynamic dashboards

Technologies Used

Excel – data cleaning, preparation, and preliminary analysis

PostgreSQL (pgAdmin) – database modeling, SQL scripting, and querying

Power BI Desktop – data visualization and dashboard creation
